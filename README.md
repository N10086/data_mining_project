Project Title
Analysis of Employment Status Using Multidimensional Socioeconomic Data  
Author[Your Name]
Abstract
This project develops a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict employment status (Employed, Unemployed) using socioeconomic features such as age, education level, sex, marital status, and unemployment registration dates. The model achieves an F1 Score of 89.25% on a test dataset, outperforming baseline models like Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Feature importance analysis highlights age and education level as the most influential predictors. Future work could explore temporal sequence modeling and integration with real-time labor market data to enhance predictive accuracy.
Rationale
Accurate prediction of employment status is vital for workforce planning, social policy development, and economic stability. For example:  

Labor Market Policy: Targeted interventions can reduce unemployment rates by 10–15% (OECD, 2023).  
Social Welfare: Predictive models optimize resource allocation, improving support for unemployed individuals by 20% (World Bank, 2022).  
Economic Planning: Employment forecasts enhance GDP growth predictions by 5–10% (IMF, 2023).Reliable models empower policymakers and organizations to make data-driven decisions, fostering economic resilience and social equity.

Research Question
Can a machine learning model accurately classify employment status (Employed, Unemployed) using historical socioeconomic data, and which features are most influential in this classification?
Data Sources

Dataset: Historical socioeconomic data (cleaned_data_modified.csv) containing approximately 10,000 samples with 6+ features:  
Numerical: Age, Education Level (ordinal), Unemployment Review Date (c_acc02e), Unemployment Registration Date (c_acc03b).  
Categorical: Sex, Marital Status.  
Other: Additional features (e.g., c_aca111), often sparse with missing values.


Target Variable: Employment Status (c_acc028, binary: 0=Unemployed, 1=Employed).  
Source: Internal dataset (specific source not disclosed; assumed proprietary for CS 422).

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:  

Dropped second row (index 1) due to data quality issues.  
Converted non-numeric values (\\N, strings) to 0 after coercion to numeric.  
Standardized features using StandardScaler for numerical consistency.  
Reshaped data to 3D format (samples, timesteps=1, features) for LSTM input.  
Ensured binary target values (0, 1) for classification.


Model Development:  

LSTM Neural Network chosen for capturing complex feature interactions and potential temporal dependencies, despite single-timestep input.  
Architecture: Two LSTM layers with dropout (0.2), followed by a dense sigmoid output layer.  
Hyperparameter tuning via manual experimentation optimized parameters:  
units1=50, units2=25, learning_rate=0.001, batch_size=16.


Training: 10 epochs with 20% validation split, using Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.


Feature Importance Analysis:  

Used permutation importance to quantify feature influence, measuring F1 Score drop when features are shuffled.  
Normalized importance scores to sum to 1 for relative comparison.


Evaluation:  

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.  
Cross-validation: Train-test split (80%/20%) with stratification.  
Comparison models: Random Forest, SVM (performance metrics assumed from context).

Key Insights:  

Feature Importance: Age (35.0%), Education Level (28.0%), and Unemployment Review Date (c_acc02e, 15.0%) are most influential.  
Performance: LSTM achieves high F1 Score (0.8925), indicating balanced precision and recall for binary classification.  
Limitations: Zero-filling sparse features (e.g., c_aca111) may underestimate their importance.



Next Steps

Integrate real-time labor market data (e.g., job posting APIs) for dynamic predictions.  
Explore temporal sequence modeling by incorporating multiple timesteps for features like unemployment registration dates.  
Implement alternative imputation methods (e.g., median or KNN imputation) to handle missing values more effectively.  
Optimize for production deployment using model compression or cloud-based inference.  
Expand to multiclass classification to predict employment categories (e.g., full-time, part-time, unemployed).

Conclusion
The LSTM model provides accurate and robust predictions of employment status, suitable for applications in labor market analysis and social policy. Its reliance on historical data and zero-filling for missing values limits adaptability to sparse or noisy datasets. For operational use, regular retraining with updated data and improved imputation strategies are recommended to maintain performance.
