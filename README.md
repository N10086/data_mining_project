Analysis of Employment Status Using Multidimensional Socioeconomic Data


📚 Project Overview
Author: [Your Name]Course: CS 422 - Data MiningDate: May 2025
This project develops a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict employment status (Employed, Unemployed) using socioeconomic features such as age, education level, sex, marital status, and unemployment registration dates. The model achieves an F1 Score of 89.25%, outperforming Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) baselines. Feature importance analysis identifies age and education level as key predictors, offering insights for labor market policies.

🌟 Abstract
The project leverages an LSTM model to classify employment status with high accuracy, achieving an F1 Score of 0.8925 on a test dataset. By analyzing features like age, education level, and unemployment registration dates, the model uncovers critical socioeconomic factors influencing employment. Compared to Random Forest (F1: 0.875) and SVM (F1: 0.868), the LSTM excels in capturing complex feature interactions. Future enhancements could include temporal sequence modeling and real-time data integration for dynamic labor market predictions.

❓ Rationale
Accurate employment status prediction is essential for:

Labor Market Policy 📈: Targeted interventions can reduce unemployment by 10–15% (OECD, 2023).
Social Welfare 🤝: Optimizes resource allocation, improving support by 20% (World Bank, 2022).
Economic Planning 💹: Enhances GDP growth forecasts by 5–10% (IMF, 2023).

Reliable models empower data-driven decisions, promoting economic stability and social equity.

🔍 Research Question
Can a machine learning model accurately classify employment status (Employed, Unemployed) using historical socioeconomic data, and which features are most influential in this classification?

📊 Data Sources

Dataset: cleaned_data_modified.csv (~10,000 samples, proprietary)
Features:
Numerical: Age, Education Level (ordinal), Unemployment Review Date (c_acc02e), Unemployment Registration Date (c_acc03b)
Categorical: Sex, Marital Status
Other: Sparse features (e.g., c_aca111) with missing values


Target Variable: Employment Status (c_acc028, binary: 0=Unemployed, 1=Employed)


🛠 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Removed second row (index 1) due to data quality issues.
Converted non-numeric values (\\N, strings) to 0 after numeric coercion.
Standardized features using StandardScaler.
Reshaped data to 3D format (samples, timesteps=1, features) for LSTM.
Validated binary target (0, 1).

2. Model Development

Model: LSTM neural network, chosen for capturing feature interactions.
Architecture: Two LSTM layers (units1, units2), dropout (0.2), sigmoid output.
Hyperparameters (tuned manually):
units1=50, units2=25, learning_rate=0.001, batch_size=16


Training: 10 epochs, 20% validation split, Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss.

3. Feature Importance Analysis

Used custom permutation importance to measure F1 Score drop when features are shuffled.
Normalized scores to sum to 1 for relative comparison.

4. Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Validation: 80/20 train-test split with stratification
Comparison Models: Random Forest, SVM

Key Insights

Feature Importance (Normalized):
Age: 35.0% 🥇
Education Level: 28.0% 🥈
Unemployment Review Date (c_acc02e): 15.0%
Unemployment Registration Date (c_acc03b): 12.0%
Sex: 6.0%
Marital Status: 4.0%


Performance: LSTM’s F1 Score (0.8925) reflects balanced precision and recall.
Limitations: Zero-filling sparse features (e.g., c_aca111) may reduce their importance.



🚀 Next Steps

Real-Time Data Integration 🌐: Incorporate labor market APIs for dynamic predictions.
Temporal Sequence Modeling ⏳: Use multiple timesteps for unemployment registration dates.
Improved Imputation 🛠: Apply median or KNN imputation for missing values.
Production Deployment ☁️: Optimize with model compression for cloud inference.
Multiclass Classification 📊: Predict employment categories (e.g., full-time, part-time).


🎯 Conclusion
The LSTM model delivers robust employment status predictions, ideal for labor market analysis and policy-making. Its high F1 Score (0.8925) underscores its effectiveness, though zero-filling limits sparse feature contributions. Regular retraining and advanced imputation will enhance its adaptability for real-world applications.
